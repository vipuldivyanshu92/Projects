        Summary
        =======
        
        *   Built for WSGI applications and middleware
        *   Sophisticated and extensible permissions system

        Changes
        =======
        
        0.4.3
        
        * Updated authkit.authenticate.form to handle the suggest change in #61
        * Added powerpack adaptors
        * Changed the multi middleware to return the WSGI response rather than
        iterating over it and yielding results.
        * Fixed #50 OpenID problem and tested on blogger.com
        * Added the ability to pass the environ dictionary to render() functions
        * Added bad cookie customisation options to fix #65 but also to allow
        bad cookie template customisation. See the docstring of the
        authkit.authenticate.cookie module.
        * Added a new algorithm based on ideas from #61 to guess the correct action
        for the form produced by the form middleware but also added support for
        an authkit.form.action option which allows you to manually override
        AuthKit's guess. (The OpenID middleware calls this baseurl)
        * Added user_set_password() methods to users API. Fixes #64.
        * Removed arabic letters from the form handler. Fixes #40.
        * Added headers to the form handling for IE. Fixes #54.
        * Adding SQLAlchemy 0.5 support, uses session.add() instead of session.save()
        * The multi handler now handles WSGI applications implemented as iterators,
        it already supported generators. The multi2.py example demonstrates this.
        * Set the pylons.status_code_redirect environment variable on all redirected
        AuthKit responses
        * Set the pylons.error_call environment variable on all redirected AuthKit
        responses
        * Trigger an error when trying to use server-side password encryption with
        digest authentication
        
        0.4.2
        
        * Applied most of #59 and tested the two OpenID examples
        * Added support for WebOb HTTPExceptions to remove a deprecation warning in
        Pylons 0.9.7
        * Fixed a missing md5 import in the cookie module
        * Applied patch in ticket #52
        
        0.4.1
        
        * Added ``setup.fakeuser`` option which automatically sets the REMOTE_USER
        so that it appears someone has signed in. Useful with setup.enable = False
        ********************************************************************************
        * The ``setup.enable = false`` option now also disables  authorisation         *
        * checks (reported by Rick Flosi)                                              *
        ********************************************************************************
        * Applied patch from Pawel Niewiadomski to fix #53
        * Changed the import of the openid.sreg module to openid.extensions.sreg
        * Fixed the encoding of the form.py file
        * Updated the examples to use the latest syntax
        * Updated the tests for the new SQLAlchemy drivers
        * Added Daniel Pronych's SQLAlchemy drivers but with significant changes
        * Fixed a bug due to a change in the latest version of Python OpenID
        so that AuthKit OpenID works with Yahoo sign-ins. Phil Kershaw #50
        * Updated the user/database example, it now works #43
        * Updated user tokens code to fix #17
        * Updated authkit.authenticate.multi so that it should fix #41 and pass
        the WSGI writable from start_response() correctly.
        * Added a form.method option so you can choose GET authentication for
        cases when another piece of middleware has already parsed the form
        variables (eg with repoze?).
        * Fixed bug in form action generation for non-standard ports
        * Fixed bug reported by Sam Gentle where remote addr is obtained from
        X_FORWARDED_FOR after multiple proxies.
        * AuthKit form authentication now picks up HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST and
        HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT when generating an action. This allows you to run
        an AuthKit app on port 80, proxied from 443 as long as you set up these
        two (slightly unstandard) variables.
        * Fixed #38, cookie sign out path should match the path specified in
        the config file.
        * Fixed #37, missing import of sys in digest authentication
        * Updated SQLAlchemy code to use SQLAlchemyManager. Needs installing
        manually with ``easy_install SQLAlchemyManager``.
        * Added a user management api_version attribute and changed the API so that
        the users object is set up on each request and recieves an environ
        argument.
        * OpenID middleware now no longer sets up beaker middleware itself. This
        should now be done manually in the middleware stack. See the example in
        examples/docs/open_id.py
        * OpenID support now upgraded to use 2.0 (from Dalius Dobravolskas)
        * Fixed encrypt typo with postgres users driver
        * The cookie middleware now has a nouserincookie option which forces the
        middleware to store the username in a Beaker session rather than in plain
        text in the cookie. See examples/docs/form_no_user_in_cookie.py for an
        example of its use.
        * Form authentication method now defaults to 200 OK rather than 401 when
        the sign in form is displayed so that it works with Safari 3 Beta.
        * The cookie middleware Bad Ticket page now also uses 200 OK, also to
        support Safari 3 Beta.
        * The cookie middleware bad ticket now logs to debug rather than error to
        avoid the ``No handlers could be found for logger
        "authkit.authenticate.cookie"`` message you get with a bad cookie if no
        error logging is specifically set up.
        * Added a user management api_version attribute and changed the API so that
        the users object is set up on each request and recieves an environ
        argument.
        * Fixed encrypt typo with postgres users driver
        * Renamed the config_paste option to app_conf in authenticate middleware. If
        you get an "No authkit.setup.method was specified" error when you are sure
        it is specified, this might be why.
        
        0.4.0
        
        * Added support for encrypted passwords
        * Fixed the IE7 bug in digest middleware
        * Adding SSO sub-directory, redirecting API, and CAS auth handler.
        * Fixed binding check to return none, instead of throwing an Exception (for
        performance reasons).
        * Moved start_response check outside of app_iter consumption since it must be
        called by this point to comply with WSGI.
        * Fixed consumption app iter in multi, loading entire response into ram.
        * Adding changelog
        * Added IP and Time based permission objects
        * Started unit tests
        * Extended the user management API and added SQLAlchemy driver and example
        * Restructured the authenticate middleware into induvidual pluggable components
        * Simplified the configuration file system
        * Added OpenID dependencies
        * Removed the larger SQLAlchemy based demos
        * The cookie module uses ``authkit`` as a default cookie name, not ``auth_tkt``.
        Any code which does anything manually with this cookie needs the name changing
        if it wasn't explicitly set to ``auth_tkt`` in the config file.
        
        0.3.0pre5
        
        * Changed the arguments to the authkit.authenticate.middleware() factory. You
        will need to update your middleware setup to use app_conf instead of
        config_paste for the app_conf dictionary.
        
        0.3
        
        * Re-written from scratch to be a modular toolkit for building your own auth
        framework rather than an all-in-one solution.
        
        0.2
        
        * Re-written from scratch so to use SQLAlchemy only, old driver system considered
        unnecessary and limiting. Also doesn't fit in with current Pylons
        best-practice.
        
        0.1
        
        * Based on the web.auth 0.6 module from www.pythonweb.org, support for SQLObject
        driver included
